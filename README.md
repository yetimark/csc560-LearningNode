Current URIs

==========

GET
---
/users
- gets all current users

/user/{id}
- gets the user named "user{id}
- this is not intuitive functionality but follows the current guide. I am sure this will change in the next assignment.

POST
----
/addUser
- adds a user that is predifined in the server.js script.
- this is also not expected use of a post but is part of the guide and I am sure this will change with the next assignment.

DELETE
------
/deleteUser
- deletes user2 as predifined in the server.js script.
- this is also not expected use of a post but is part of the guide and I am sure this will change with the next assignment.
